All artwork and music is original and drawn over the course of the Penn Play 2014 game jam.

Move around using the arrow keys and send projectiles using the space bar.  Have fun and please enjoy the scenery!

“Welcome to our game Artventure, where you play as Rho, an androgynous artist, who is exploring different media (Doodle, Pixel, and Paint) by *literally* jumping into the canvas.  You can shoot projectiles (just for fun) and even chase a crazy cat around the scenery (although it sometimes chooses to defy gravity and wander beyond your limits).  We hope you appreciate the completely original artwork and music (all created in during the hackathon) and enjoy traipsing through the landscapes!”

Best wishes,
